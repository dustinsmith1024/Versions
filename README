Versions

This is an attempt to make a simple API for version tagging on a (my) blog.  It is going to be a simple REST API that runs on node.js.

It should attach to a blog with 1 line of code.

Something like:  

  http://versions.heroku.com/nodejs/v0.4.3/

  Will return:

  [ { language: "node.js",
      version_request: "v0.4.3",
      current_version: "v0.4.4",
      is_current:, "no",
      is_current_minor: "no",
      is_current_major: "yes",
      link: "http://node.js"
  } ]
